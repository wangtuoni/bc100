# Lesson Outline

## Slideshow
Slideshows are a very common JavaScript task. This will allow us to re-enforce the fundamentals of JavaScript while applying to something new. In order to layout our slideshow we will need to deal with Positioning and stacking order (z-index), this will be a good review. We will also introduce a few new JavaScript concepts along the way.

## Terminology/Acronym helpers
* Scope: Scope determines when a variable or function is available to be used.
* Encapsulation: Keeping code self contained to avoid collisions.
* Hoisting: A way of describing how JavaScript handles the declaration of variables and functions. Understanding these rules will help you manage your variables and functions so that they are available when needed, and hidden when not (encapsulation).

## Slideshow Lesson
In this lesson we will:
* Review JS Syntax from week before
* Examine how javascript deals with scope, and a process we call Hoisting.
* Use CSS to lay out our slides for our Slideshow
* Use JavaScript to make our slideshows fade and slide.

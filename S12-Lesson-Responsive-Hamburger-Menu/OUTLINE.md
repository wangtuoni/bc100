# Lesson Outline

## Responsive Hamburger Menu
A very common feature for responsive websites is the Hamburger Menu. The Hamburger Menu icon displays in mobile view, and allows the user to expand and contract the navigation of a website. Our goal is to implement this feature, while preserving the medium and large view navigational systems without the hamburger menu.

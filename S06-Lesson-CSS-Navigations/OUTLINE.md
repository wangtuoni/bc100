# Lesson Outline

## CSS Navigations
This lesson deepens our understanding of CSS by controlling the look and behavior of navigational systems. We also get to explore backgound css, and image sprite optimization.

## Terminology/Acronym helpers
* Image Sprite: a single image that holds several states of an animation. Or in the case of our CSS navigationsâ€“the various states of our links (e.g. static, hover, active)
* Pseudo Class: Pseudo means imposter. In this context, CSS (appearance) is moving into JavaScript (behavior) territory to manage the look of our navigational element.
* State: the state of an element (e.g. static, hover, active)

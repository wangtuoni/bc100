# Lesson Outline

## JavaScript
CSS Positioning is a means to place elements on the page based on coordinates (left, top, right and/or bottom). In this lesson we explore the many positioning contexts along with when to use which and why. We will also explore how fonts are implemented, both browser safe fonts and embedding fonts.

## Terminology/Acronym helpers
* DOM: The Document Object Model. Its JavaScripts model of how the page is set up. Its sees a tree of HTML nodes, and containers of content, that are repesented as objects (having properties and behaviors associated with each element). You will hear people say traversing the DOM, as they use JavaScript to move up and down the tree.
* Comments: A way to write notes about our code. Also used to enable and disable (troubleshoot) commands.
* String: A data type of characters, typically delimited by quotes.
* Number: A data type of intergers and floats. Used to calculate (add, subtracy, multiply, divide)
* Variables: In programming, variables are a container/reference to something (e.g. a string of text, a number, an object)
* Alert: triggering a browser pop up to warn or confirm user choices
* Console: Used to debug, monitor values and break down our scripts. Mostly intended for the developer. (e.g. log, dir, table)
* Function/Method: A collection of commands that will execute when you call the function/method name.
* Function Call: Calling a function to execute its set of commands.
* Event Listener: Assigning a function/method to an element on our page, connected to an event (e.g. mouseover, click). The browser then listens for this event to trigger before executing said function/method.


## JavaScript Lesson
In this lesson we will:
* Explore fundamental JavaScript syntax (comments, alerts, console, variables, strings, numbers)
* Use JavaScript to select elements on the page and assign event listseners that perform various hovering techniques.

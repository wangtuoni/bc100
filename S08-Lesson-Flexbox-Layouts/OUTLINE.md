# Lesson Outline

## Flexbox
Flexbox was introduced to make it easier to layout out elements side-by-side.
It aims to solve columned spatial relationships, and vertical alignment.

## Terminology/Acronym helpers
* Floats: a technique used to wrap text around a block (typically an image). Before flexbox, we were forced to use Floats for layout.
* Semantics: Words of a language hold an agreed upon meaning. HTML tags were created to mark up and define their contents in a meaningful way. h1 is more important that h2, or p. Tables are meant to hold tabular data. Abusing these defined roles decreases the accessiblity of our website. We have abused tags in the past to try to achieve a particular look or behavior.
* CSS Flexbox: A CSS solution for layout elements on a page.
* CSS Grid: a proposed CSS solution for providing grid patterns in design (e.g. 12-column grid). Once supported, is meant to work with CSS Flexbox.
* Grid Systems: A means of laying out elements across a grid to enforce continuity and logical relationships with all objects in your layout.

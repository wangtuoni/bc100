# Lesson Outline

## Tag, Class and IDs
The three fundamental selector types govern how we select elements on the oage to both style and control their behavior. Understanding these 3 selector types will give you more control over the way your page looks and behaves.

## Terminology/Acronym helpers
* Tag: Any existing HTML element (e.g. h1, h2, p, div). Tags are the least specific.
* Class: A label for HTML tags that defines a series of elements. Classes are more specific than tags.
* ID: A label for HTML tags that defines a unique element (there can be only one). ID's are the most specific.

# Lesson Outline

## Responsive And Floats
This lesson uses what we have learned with HTML and CSS to control the look of a website for various screen sizes. Responsive is a device-agnostic approach to Web Design. Rather than trying to build a website for every device, Responsive aims to break the layout at various screen widths. Encouraging us to build one website that serves all devices. Coupled with a Mobile first commitment, we design our layouts starting from mobile, and working our way up to notepad, desktop and large screens.

We will also examine floats. Both for its traditional use, and for laying our elements horizontally.
